# Welcome to Our E-Commerce Platform

## 👥 Meet the Project Team – E-Commerce Microservices Project (2025)

Welcome to our official GitHub Organization Wiki! We are a team of passionate software engineering interns who collaborated on the project. Over an intensive learning journey, we built a scalable, cloud-ready **E-Commerce Platform** using cutting-edge technologies and industry best practices.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Our platform follows a **Microservices Architecture**, with each business capability isolated into its own service for scalability, maintainability, and team ownership. The system includes:

| Microservice         | Description |

| `store-api`          | Store management, linking products to sellers. |
| `order-api`          | Handles customer orders and order history. |
| `bank-api`           | Manages internal bank accounts and mock transactions. |
| `coupon-api`         | Supports discount coupon creation and validation. |
| `notification-api`   | Sends notifications (e.g., order status) via email/SMS. |
| `api-gateway`        | Unified entry point with route management and filtering. |
| `service-registry`   | Eureka-based service discovery for internal communication. |
| `saga-events`        | Manages distributed transactions using Saga pattern. |
| `frontend`           | Angular-based responsive frontend for customers. |
